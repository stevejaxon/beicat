# BeiCat
A cat-themed Doodle Jump clone written in Godot


## Etymology
The project itself is inspired by the simple, classic game [Doodle Jump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doodle_Jump) - in which, as the name would imply, the protagonist has to continually jump on platforms to reach new heights.

BeiCat is a portmanteau of *beicaf* ([a Welsh word for jump](https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/the-meaning-of/welsh-word-d634b8ac760c341fbcf9c3e6f9eb22ec495a40df.html)) and *cat*.
